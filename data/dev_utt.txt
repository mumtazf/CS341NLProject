I am a travel influencer that would like to buy a laptop that is lightweight and good for video editing
My laptop broke and I am a college student, what is a budget friendly laptop.
I don't care about memory, just give me the basic 15.6 display laptop.
I would like a computer that has at least 8GB of memory to store photos.
I'm picky with my brands, can you give me recommendations for an HP laptop?
