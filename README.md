# Laptop Recommendation Chatbot

This repository contains the code for our laptop recommendation chatbot. Navigate to `chat.py` and run it to start the chatbot interaction. Currently, the chatbot uses
rule-based NER to find keywords in the user responses. 

`user.py` contains User class that stores user preferences

`rule_based_ner.py` contains the skeleton of keywords being used for rule-based ner. The extraction of keywords from responses takes place in `chat.py`.
